Artifacts and model output locations

- artifacts/
  - Created by earlier CPU notebook runs
  - Contains: scaler.joblib, lgbm_model.joblib, xgb_model.joblib, metrics.json

- artifacts_3090/
  - Created by GPU (GBDT_3090.ipynb) runs
  - Contains: imputer.joblib, scaler.joblib, lgbm_model.joblib, xgb_gpu_model.joblib, metrics.json

- saved models/
  - Created by a prior GPU notebook cell
  - Contains: imputer.joblib, scaler.joblib, lgbm_model.joblib, xgb_gpu_model.joblib, metrics.json, training_3090_details.txt
  - Note: folder name includes a space

- saved_models/
  - Current default output from GBDT_3090_fixed.ipynb
  - Contains: imputer.joblib, scaler.joblib, lgbm_model.joblib, xgb_gpu_model.joblib, metrics.json, training_3090_details.txt
  - Preferred folder (no space in name)

Are we still saving to artifacts?
- No. The fixed notebook saves to saved_models/ by default. Legacy folders (artifacts/, artifacts_3090/, and saved models/) may still exist from earlier runs but are not used by the new notebook.
